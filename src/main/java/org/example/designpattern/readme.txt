why?
Why we need to study design pattern? If we don't use them, Do we have problems that we can't solve?
The question is no, if you learned design pattern, Your code will be more elegant, Your code will be
comfortable and logical for others to look at ã€‚
what?
Design patterns represent best practices and are typically adopted by experienced object-oriented
software developers. Design patterns are solutions to general problems faced by software developers
during the software development process. These solutions have been summarized by numerous software
developers after a considerable period of experimentation and error.
Design patterns are a set of code design experiences that have been repeatedly used, widely known,
categorized, and cataloged. The use of design patterns is to reuse code, make it easier for others
to understand, and ensure code reliability. Undoubtedly, design patterns are a win-win situation for
oneself, others, and the system. Design patterns make code development truly engineering, and they
are the cornerstone of software engineering, like the bricks and stones of a building. Reasonably
applying design patterns in a project can perfectly solve many problems, and each pattern has
corresponding principles in reality. Each pattern describes a recurring problem around us and the core
solution to the problem, which is also the reason why design patterns can be widely applied.
